            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I'd previously made another card game for my friends ("The Muffin Game")<br>
            The game came with 2 key problems: The deck was way too big, and the game was too complex<br>
            To solve this, I planned to make the game around 54 cards and the base mechanic of "actions then draw"<br>
            I also knew this game was to be designed for my friends to enjoy, so should be a party-style game</p>
            <p>In order to make the initial draft, I first made sure I had a fun card game before adding any art</p>
            <p>Once the initial draft was complete, it came time to add some theming to give the deck character.<br>
            The mechanic of drawing cards to reach a final high value card made me think of a mine</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Initial Version</h2>
            <p>This first version had no art yet, and was just printed cards packed into sleeves with pokemon cards.</p>
            <p>After playing this version with my friends, it was clear that pretty much all the mechanics were right.<br>
            There were just a few issues: The point values were too high, and the Coerce card was a pointless inclusion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Balancing Update</h2>
            <p>After updating the cards from this feedback, it was clear that the game itself was ready.</p>
            <p>The game can be exploited, but that depends on the group you play with - good for a party game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Art Update</h2>
            <p>At this stage, it came time for the deck to get some art.</p>
            <p>Initially, the art was going to be vector art of human characters.<br>
            I then realised I have no art experience, and the little friends project did not warrant learning to draw.<br>
            As a result, the design pivotted to a simpler 8-bit style which I am more comfortable with.<br>
            This new paradigm made it difficult to have expressive humans, and thus the titular slime was born.</p>

            <h2>Distribution Notes</h2>
            <p>I'd now achieved what I set out to do: make a fun card game for my friends.<br>
            So I then thought, why not sell it? Worst case nothing happens, and best case I make some money.</p>

            <h2>Taking Feedback</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Game was developed for friends with the express intent of being fun</li>
                <li>One big criticism was due to how high the scores were, it made the two player experience dreadful</li>
                <li>Showing the game to other friends led to a Print-N-Play version</li>
                <li>Personal feedback in knowing what I was able to do</li>
            </ul>

        <div class = "box">
            <h2>Game Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I made a game - pretty clear evidence</li>
                <li>Brand management - the game took heavy inspiration from Exploding Kittens to make the template</li>
                <li>(Anecdotal Evidence) My friends enjoyed playing the game daily, so I must've done good</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Business Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Having to think about HOW I was selling the game (Where, What price?, What audience?)</li>
                <li>Optimizing cost for profit per item and overall sales</li>
                <li>By restricting myself to 54 cards I trade a more chaotic game for a more cost effective one</li>
