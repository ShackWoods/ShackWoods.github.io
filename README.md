# About Me

G'day, I'm NAME NOT FOUND studying Computer Science at INSTITUTE NOT FOUND.

I'm yet to do anything cool - come back later.

I'm interesting in computer organization and programming languages - currently learning about compilers.

I enjoy playing [Pok√©mon VGC](https://shackwoods.github.io/PKMN/VGC/).

Ook probeer ik om Nederlands te leren.
